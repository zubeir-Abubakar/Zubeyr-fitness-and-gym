					<h2>Our Classes</h2>
					<p>Most of us start a New Year with the best intentions in the world – we are determined to get fitter, faster, stronger and leaner – however keeping these resolutions never seems quite as easy as it sounds. It can often be hard to motivate ourselves to get out there and go for that run or head to the gym – especially during the cold, dark winter months.
						Gym classes are a great way of keeping those motivation levels high and ensuring that you get the most out of every workout. Mixing up your gym routine is also a great way of keeping things interesting and thats when Zubeyr's Gym and fitness come in. Some of out classes include:- </p>

					Although it is important to fit your workout schedule around your other obligations, you can hardly expect to get a six-pack from doing ten crunches once a week. If you are serious about slimming down, or toning up, you have to be realistic and put in enough effort to make it happen. Working out less than three times a week might help with weight maintenance, but in order to keep your metabolism in over-drive you have to commit to working out on at least four to six days a week.  	 	  	   	   </p>
